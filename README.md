Current progress completed:
-
① Completed annotation of 300 worm datasets.

② Successfully tracked the movement trajectory of the worm.

③ Drew the skeleton of each worm.

④ Calculate the worm velocity based on Euclidean distance.

Future features to be implemented:
-
① Dealing with occlusion counting issues.

② Counting of insect eggs and annotation of datasets.

③ Annotate worm datasets to 1k or more.

④ Draw the past movement trajectory of each worm.

⑤ Implement integration with the database (including basic information about each worm).

⑥ Calculate the rotation angle, wavelength, and perfect speed of each worm.

Future applications:
-
① Research needs

② Applied to pollution environment detection
